Hi!
Thank you for purchase!

If you want to achieve the same visuals as on screenshots and video, check the Color Space settings in Player Settings, it should be set to Linear. Also check the Render Path settings in Graphics Settings, it should be set to Deferred.
Use free Unity 'Post Processing Stack' camera effects, which is available through the Package Manager, and the adjusted profile for that, which can be founded at the QA Modular Parking root folder.

If you have problems with this package, please, let me know mr.andreyvolkov@gmail.com

Don't forget to build your own original levels with this modular kit :)
